    description: I study pulsars, which are fast spinning collapsed stars. Their lighthouse-like radio beams are observed as pulses from the Earth. They are amongst the most extreme objects of the Universe - they are some of the fastest spinning stars (usually, they undergo one complete revolution in less than a few seconds); they are the smallest and densest stars, with approximately the mass of our Sun contained in a radius of a few tens of kilometres; and they have the strongest stellar magnetic fields.

    description: Of about 2800 pulsars discovered, only about 29 are situated outside our galaxy, the Milky Way. The aim of my thesis at the University of Manchester is to discover more extragalactic pulsars using a new radio observatory, MeerKAT. It is a precursor of the mid-frequency component of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), an international project to build the largest radio interferometer ever designed. MeerKAT is located in South Africa, in the radio-protected Karoo desert. With its 64 14-metre dishes, it will be the most sensitive radio interferometer in its wavelength range.
