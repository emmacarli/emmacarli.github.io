        Observations will be conducted in the radio band with the MeerKAT telescope, a radio dish interferometer approaching completion in South Africa. The MeerKAT telescope is a precursor of the mid-frequency component of the Square Kilometer Array, an international project to build the largest radio interferometer ever designed. MeerKAT is located in South Africa, in the Karoo desert. It will be the most sensitive radio interferometer in its wavelength range. It consists of 64 Gregorian dishes, each of 13.96m diameter. The furthest dishes have a maximum separation of 8 km. This project is part of a larger MeerKAT pulsar survey, TRAPUM. Image: South African Radio Astronomy Observatory

         A pulsar is a type of neutron star. Their lighthouse-like radio beams are observed as pulses from the Earth. These collapsed stars are amongst the most extreme objects of the Universe - they are some of the fastest spinning stars (usually, they undergo one complete revolution in less than a few seconds); they are the smallest and densest stars, with approximately the mass of our Sun contained in a radius of a few tens of kilometres; and they have the strongest stellar magnetic fields.

         Since their discovery in 1967, pulsars have been a formidable “laboratory” for several fields of science. Their pulses can have a better ability in timekeeping than atomic clocks. Any variations in the timing of these pulses can be an indicator of astrophysical processes such as gravitational waves, companion stars, planets, superdense matter states, relativistic plasma mechanisms, etc. In addition, by extending the extragalactic sample of known pulsars, we will be able to perform Magellanic Cloud neutron star population studies. For example, we could understand better how galactic metallicity affects the formation of neutron stars, or predict double neutron star merger rates. Finally, the dispersion and scattering of radio waves by the ISM give an estimation of its structure between us and the Magellanic Clouds.

The aim of my PhD is to search for new pulsars, an uncommon type of star with unique physical properties, outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.
